Legalmation application coding challenge
This project uses Python and Flask. Necessary libraries are in requirements.txt and must be installed prior. This can be done with pip install -r requirements.txt, as mentioned in the file as well.

# Setup

1. Download files from github
2. Create a virtual environment where the files are downloaded (Done easily if you're running this project in an IDE, or can be done with the help of this site (https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) or googling)
3. Activate the venv (can be done with the help of the above page)
4. Run the file, then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your browser, the app should be running


If the user fails to upload a valid file (xml) then they're redirected to another page informing them. However, if they do upload an XML they don't receive any feedback. Mentioned just so the user knows that, just because there's no response doesn't mean your files aren't being taken and parsed. This can be verified by going to the files page with the button.
